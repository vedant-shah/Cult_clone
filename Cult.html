        <summary>It’s my first cult class. What can I expect?</summary>
        <p>
          We are super excited and can’t wait to see you at the center and help
          you get started on your fitness journey! Here’s a few things we want
          you to take care of since it is your very first session with cult.
          BEFORE CLASS Arrive 15 minutes early:&nbsp;Drop in 15 minutes early so
          that you can get a hang of things at the center. Center manager will
          be checking your body temperature, oxygen level and status on the
          Aarogya Setu app.We do not encourage our members to work out if they
          come later than 5 mins from the session start time. Eat one hour
          before class: Have a light, simple snack about an hour before your
          session. Grab a banana/bowl of oats/few almonds or nuts, it’ll charge
          you up and also help prevent dizziness in your initial sessions.&nbsp;
          Bring your own kit: We do not encourage our members to workout without
          shoes as they protect you from common workout-related injuries. Due to
          COVID-19, we request you to bring your own kit: Yoga mats, Hand towel
          and water bottle. Weights, boxing bags and resistance bands are
          available at the center.&nbsp; Mark your attendance:&nbsp;Marking your
          attendance is mandatory. Mark your attendance to avoid a No-Show Keep
          your belongings safe: Due to COVID-19, lockers are not accessible at
          the centers, please do not carry any valuables to the center.&nbsp;
          DURING CLASS Inform about injuries:&nbsp;Let the trainer know about
          any injuries you may have Define your own pace: Take it easy. Complete
          the workouts at your own pace and whenever you feel uncomfortable,
          stop and let the trainer know&nbsp; AFTER CLASS&nbsp; No waiting at
          the centre: We deeply sanitise the center after every session. Once
          your workout is done, you can talk to the trainer in case of any
          doubts but shower facilities will not be available.&nbsp; Minimize
          muscle soreness: You might have soreness in your muscles for 2-3 days
          after your first class but don’t worry, it’s absolutely normal...And
          strangely, it’ll feel satisfyingly great!! A good warm up and the
          right cool down (stretch) will minimize soreness to a large extent. A
          cold water shower after exercise also helps&nbsp; Ideal recovery
          meal:&nbsp; Grab a meal that contains easily digestible proteins (like
          a bowl of pulses) within 30-45 mins of the workout. Avoid dairy or
          heavily processed protein powders. Drink 2.5-3 litres of water daily
          to replace the lost fluids.
